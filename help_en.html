<h1>Multisensory Road Condition Analysis</h1>
<p>Version 2.01</p>
<p>This application lets you load ROS&nbsp;2 bag files and inspect IMU
signals together with synchronized GPS tracks, videos and point
clouds.  Use the menu bar to open a bag and select the IMU topics you
want to analyse.</p>
<h2>Acceleration Signals</h2>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Raw Acceleration</td><td>Direct measurements from the IMU.</td></tr>
<tr><td>g-corrected Acceleration</td><td>Acceleration corrected for gravity.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Vehicle Frame Acceleration</td><td>Acceleration rotated into the vehicle frame.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ISO Weighted</td><td>Acceleration filtered using ISO&nbsp;2631â€‘1 weighting.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Map and Videos</h2>
<p>The map tab displays the GPS track with optional heading arrows.
Peaks detected in the acceleration signal are marked by black star
icons.  Clicking on a star opens the video/point cloud tab and shows a
short clip around that time.  You can also click star markers in the
plots to jump directly to the corresponding video segment.</p>
<h2>Settings Parameters</h2>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>Mounting Overrides</td><td>Manually specify sensor&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;vehicle rotation matrices.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rotation Mode</td><td>Choose between stored overrides or automatic alignment.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Peak Detection</td><td>Configure ISO peak threshold, minimum distance and whether only the maximum peak is kept.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Weighting Mode</td><td>Toggle between comfort (default) and health weighting.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Exported CSV/JSON</h2>
<p>The <code>Export&nbsp;CSV</code> command writes a CSV file with all
processed signals and labels.  A simplified example is shown below:</p>
<pre>
time,time_abs,accel_x,accel_y,accel_z,speed_mps,accel_corr_x,accel_corr_y,accel_corr_z,label_name
0.00,1700000000.00,0.04,0.02,9.81,0.00,0.04,0.02,-0.05,unknown
</pre>
<p>A JSON file with the same stem stores meta information such as sensor
model and rotation matrix:</p>
<pre>
{
  "file_format": "imu_v1",
  "sensor_topic": "/imu0",
  "sensor_fs_accel_g": 16,
  "rotation_available": true,
  "vehicle_rot_mat": [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]],
  "sampling_rate_hz": 50.0
}
</pre>
